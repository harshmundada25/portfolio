      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a motivated <strong>Computer Science Engineering undergraduate</strong>
        with a strong interest in <strong>software development, problem-solving,
        and emerging technologies</strong>. I enjoy building efficient,
        scalable, and user-focused solutions through clean and maintainable code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have hands-on experience with <strong>Data Structures and Algorithms,
        Operating Systems, Web Development, and Android Application Development</strong>.
        Through academic and personal projects, I have gained exposure to
        real-world development workflows, debugging practices, and performance
        optimization.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have worked on <strong>web applications, UI-driven designs, and
        algorithm-based solutions</strong>, strengthening my understanding of
        core computer science concepts while applying them to practical use
        cases. I am comfortable working independently as well as collaborating
        in team-based environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am focused on <strong>strengthening my fundamentals,
        improving problem-solving skills, and writing production-quality code</strong>.
        I am actively exploring <strong>Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence,
        and Machine Learning</strong> to broaden my technical perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        I believe in <strong>consistent learning, adaptability, and continuous
        improvement</strong>. I am actively seeking <strong>internship and
        entry-level opportunities</strong> where I can contribute meaningfully,
        learn from experienced professionals, and grow as a software engineer.
